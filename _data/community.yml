  description: "This model makes predictions about the future that are dependent on\
    \ a particular set \r\n    of assumptions about how interventions are implemented\
    \ and how effective they are. \r\n    Estimates of spatio-temporal COVID-19 demand\
    \ and medical system critical care supply \r\n    were calculated for all continental\
    \ US counties. These estimates were statistically \r\n    summarized and mapped\
    \ for US counties, regions and urban versus non-urban areas. Estimates \r\n  \
    \  of COVID-19 infections and patients needing critical care were calculated for\
    \ 21-day and \r\n    42-day time periods starting from April 2, 2020 to May 13,\
    \ 2020 for a reactive pattern of \r\n    30% contact reduction (\"70contact\"\
    ) through actions such as social distancing. Multiple \r\n    national public\
    \ and private datasets were linked and harmonized in order to calculate \r\n \
    \   county-level hospital critical care bed counts that include currently available\
    \ beds and \r\n    those that could be made available under four surge response\
    \ scenarios \u2013 very low, low, \r\n    medium, and high \u2013 as well as deaths\
    \ in counties that had exceeded their hospital critical \r\n    care capacity\
    \ limits.\r\nCitation: \"Sen Pei, Jeffrey Shaman, Initial Simulation of SARS-CoV2\
