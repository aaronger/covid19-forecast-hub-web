  description: "We've built a simulator based on the SEIS model with learned parameters\
    \ to make daily projections regarding \r\n    COVID-19 infections and deaths in\
    \ all 50 US states and 40 countries. The model also accounts for the possible\
    \ \r\n    effects of the relaxing of social distancing guidelines across the US\
    \ and Europe. The parameters/inputs of this \r\n    simulator are learned using\
    \ hyperparameter optimization that minimizes the error between the projected outputs\
    \ \r\n    (projected daily deaths) and the actual results (reported daily deaths).\
    \ Because the infections curve is unique \r\n    for every region, we let the\
    \ model use each region's own data to learn the best set of parameters for that\
    \ region. \r\n    This includes parameters such as: mortality rate, initial R_0,\
    \ post-lockdown R, and the inflection date of any lockdowns. \r\n    Other variables\
    \ such as the latency period, infectious period, and virus shedding period are\
    \ fixed based on published \r\n    literature. After some additional validation\
    \ techniques to minimize overfitting, we use the learned parameters to \r\n  \
    \  simulate the future and make projections."

  description: "This model makes predictions about the future, unconditional on particular\
    \ intervention strategies.\r\n    The model consists of two processes. The first\
    \ process is a statistical model of how the \r\n    number of COVID-19 infections\
    \ changes over time. The second process maps the number of \r\n    infections\
    \ to the reported data. We model the growth of new cases as the product of a \r\
    \n    dynamic growth parameter and the underlying numbers of susceptible and infected\
    \ cases \r\n    in the population at the previous time step, scaled by the size\
    \ of the state's starting \r\n    susceptible population. The growth parameter\
    \ can be thought of as the transmissibility of \r\n    the virus in that state\
    \ on that date. To model new deaths in the population, we assume that a \r\n \
    \   fraction of the newly generated cases will die and learn that fraction from\
    \ observations. \r\n    We can also anticipate when the outbreak is likely to\
    \ peak, i.e. when the daily number of new \r\n    confirmed cases reaches its\
    \ maximum.\"\r\ncitation: https://covid-19.bsvgateway.org/"
