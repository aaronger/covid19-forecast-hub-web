    \n    People from the Exposed compartment(E) with symptoms go into the reported\
    \ infections (Ir) compartment. People with mild or no symptoms go into the unreported\
    \ infections compartment.\r\n    Both reported infections (Ir) and unreported\
    \ infections (Iu) contribute to disease spread, but at different rates - a low\
    \ spread for people quarantined in compartment Ir, and a high spread for, often,\
    \ asymptomatic people in compartment Iu. This handles the quarantine measures\
    \ taken by countries to limit the infections.\r\n    Some people in reported infections\
    \ (Iu) recover (compartment C) and some die (compartment D)\r\n    All people\
    \ in unreported infections (Iu) recover (compartment Cu), there are no mortalities\
    \ in this compartment. If their symptoms were serious enough they would be reported\
    \ (and therefore in compartment Ir).\r\n    We fit our model to reported confirmed\
    \ cases and reported deaths in a region to estimate beta1 and beta2 for that region.\
    \ For other parameters, we use estimates from other studies as starting point\
    \ and learn using hyperparameter optimization that minimizes the error between\
