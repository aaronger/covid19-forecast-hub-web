  description: "This model makes predictions about the future that are dependent on\
    \ the assumption \r\n    that current interventions continue. \r\n    The GLEAM\
    \ framework is based on a metapopulation approach in which the world is divided\r\
    \n    into geographical subpopulations. Human mobility between subpopulations\
    \ is represented on a network. \r\n    This mobility data layer identifies the\
    \ numbers of individuals traveling from one sub-population to \r\n    another.\
    \ The mobility network is made up of different kinds of mobility processes, from\
    \ short-range\r\n    commuting between nearby subpopulations to intercontinental\
    \ flights. To model short-range mobility \r\n    such as commuting or car travel,\
    \ we rely on databases collected from the Offices of Statistics of 30 \r\n   \
    \ countries on five continents. Superimposed on the worldwide population and mobility\
    \ layers is an \r\n    agent-based epidemic model that defines the infection and\
    \ population dynamics. \r\ncitation: https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/58e6558acc00ee8e4536c1f5/5e8bab44f5baae4c1c2a75d2_GLEAM_web.pdf"
