Replicating a recent successful collaboration between scientists at the US CDC with academic and industry research groups to forecast influenza outbreaks, the COVID-19 Forecast Hub modeling consortium was founded to improve our understanding about the COVID-19 outbreak. In an open, collaborative environment, all serious researchers and data scientists with models that can predict the course of the COVID-19 are welcomed to submit their models to the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. The diversity of modeling approaches informs decision-makers about the possible future trajectories of the COVID-19 outbreak. And we improve our understanding about what models can and cannot tell us about the future.
