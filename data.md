    content: Data is at the heart of our teamâ€™s effort to better predict the spread of COVID-19 in the US. Whether you want to browse our interactive forecast visualization or get your hands on the raw forecasts themseves, we can point you in the right direction. Using systems developed from previous collaborative research in forecasting infectious disease, we have been systematically tracking data from multiple different COVID-19 prediction models since early April 2020. These data are stored in a structured data repository on GitHub and are also available through our Zoltar API. All data are available under a CC-BY-4.0 license.
