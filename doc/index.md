The COVID-19 Forecast Hub serves as a central repository of forecasts and predictions from over 20 international research groups. Over 25m rows of forecast data (raw output from the model itself, but not the model code) are stored in a standard format in our [data repository](https://zoltardata.com/project/44). This makes it easy to compare the models side-by-side, which in turn helps decision-makers and the general public understand the range of possible future outcomes more clearly.  

Teams submit, for the state and national level in the US, predictions of the numbers of new hospitalizations and incident and cumulative deaths in future days, weeks, and months. We encourage teams to submit at least one forecast every week (up to one a day is accepted) before a Monday 6pm deadline. After this deadline passes, we create an [ensemble forecast](./ensemble/) that, similar to weather forecast models, combines multiple models into a single prediction and cone of uncertainty. 

Every Tuesday morning, our latest ensemble forecast is available for browsing at our [interactive visualization](https://reichlab.io/covid19-forecast-hub/).
Additionally, All model data is passed along to the [US CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html), and individual forecasts from the teams, as well as the ensemble forecast, are used in official CDC communications about the trajectory of the COVID-19 outbreak. FiveThirtyEight also maintains a [forecast tracker](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/covid-forecasts/) of a selection of individual models.
