Since 2016, our team has worked closely with the US CDC on forecasting seasonal influenza outbreaks in a project called <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/flusight/index.html" target="_blank">FluSight</a>. This collaborative research framework has served as a model for setting up the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. 

This collaborative network has published numerous peer-reviewed research articles on infectious disease forecasting that provide a solid foundation for understanding how to best forecast outbreaks. For example, our work has found that there <a href="https://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1812594116" target="_blank">was not a large difference in predictive performance between mechanistic and statistical models</a> of seasonal influenza outbreaks. We also showed <a href="https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007486" target="_blank">modest but measurable improvements in accuracy when using an ensemble forecast</a> to forecast influenza.
